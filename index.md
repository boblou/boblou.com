Hello!

My name is Robert Lou, but I go by Bob. I am a MD/MBA candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to medical school, I was a software engineer at MathWorks. And before that, I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Naturally, I am broadly interested in the intersection of technology and medicine. My long term mission is to improve clinical medicine through artificial intelligence technologies. My resume can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/resume.pdf).
