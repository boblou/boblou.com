Hello! My name is Robert Lou, but I go by Bob. Currently, I am a medical student at Perelman School of Medicine. Before medical school, I was a software engineer at MathWorks. And before that, I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Naturally, I am broadly interested in the intersection of technology and medicine. My resume can be found [here](/assets/docs/resume.pdf).
