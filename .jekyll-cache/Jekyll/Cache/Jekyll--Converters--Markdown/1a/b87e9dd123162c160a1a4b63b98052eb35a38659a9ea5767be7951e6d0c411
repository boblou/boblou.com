I"Å<p>The photo of a railroad disappearing into the distance at a singular point is a classic image that demonstrates the intuitive notion that farther away objects appear smaller. We can be even more precise and say that the apparent size is directly proportional to the distance, that is, a ten foot tree will appear the same size as a twenty foot tree that is twice as far. Similarly, in the photo, we could count the pixels between the two rails and find a point <em>x</em>, where the track has narrowed by 50% compared to point <em>y</em>. <em>x</em>  would indicate a point that is twice as far as <em>y</em>. If we knew how far some point in the tracks was, we could calculate the distance of any other point along the tracks, just from a photo. There are other interesting properties to consider in the photo: we a see a singular vanishing point at which the parallel rails converge. I have drawn some boxes with one, two, and three such vanishing points.</p>
