I"«<p>Unbeknown to me at the time of reading, the sham foreword to Lolita is actually written by Nabokov. The foreword declares that the novel would be a classic in psychiatric circles, and so with my present knowledge of Lolita as a literary classic, the foreword seemed genuine. The foreword is somewhat sympathetic to Humbert in that it acknowledges his atrocities, but praises his ability to describe his love for Lolita.</p>
