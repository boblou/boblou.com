<p>Since 2007, list price increases have been an annual constant in the world of EpiPen sales. Mylan acquired the exclusive rights to EpiPen in 2007 when the list price of a 2-pack was $93.88. That price skyrocketed to $608.61 by 2016, a CAGR of 23%. However, over the same time period, the cost to produce a 2-pack remained relatively consistent at around $70. In a class action lawsuit, EpiPen users contend that this increase in price was thus caused by Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs) inducing and/or colluding with Mylan to increase list prices for their own financial benefit. The plaintiffs claim that market consolidation, closed formularies, and an opaque rebates system were tools used by the PBMs to drive up list prices.</p>
