<p>Hello! My name is Robert Lou, but I go by Bob. I am a MD/MBA candidate at University of Pennsylvania. Prior to medical school, I was a software engineer at MathWorks. And before that, I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Naturally, I am broadly interested in the intersection of technology and medicine. My long term mission is to improve clinical medicine through artificial intelligence technologies. My resume can be found <a href="/~rl2595/assets/docs/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
