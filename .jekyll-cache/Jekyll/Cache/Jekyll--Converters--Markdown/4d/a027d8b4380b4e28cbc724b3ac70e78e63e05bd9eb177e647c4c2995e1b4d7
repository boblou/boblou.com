Blue Hill is more than a restaurant, clearly, given their location on the farm. You can take a tour of the farm where you can see your eventual dinner in the ground. It is a sort of strange juxtaposition of ultra fine dining on one side suits and all, while the other side is whole vegetables, sustainability, and farm education.</p>
